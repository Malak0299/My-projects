# My Python & Processing Projects

This repository is a collection of my personal projects and experiments written in **Python** and **Processing (Python mode)**.  
It includes everything from early syntax practice to GUI applications and creative sketches.

---

## Purpose

Over time, I created many small projects and experiments across different folders and repositories.  
This repository consolidates them into one organized location — both for easier management and to document my learning process.

---

## Contents

- **Python Basics** — short scripts exploring syntax, logic, and data structures  
- **Python GUI Projects** — small graphical interfaces and application prototypes  
- **Processing (Python mode)** — visual and generative art projects using Processing’s Python environment  
- **Miscellaneous Code** — utilities, test scripts, and experimental snippets

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**  
- **VS Code** as the main development environment  
- **Processing (Python mode)** for visual sketches  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and project management  

---

## Notes

- Many projects are experimental or works in progress created for learning and exploration.  
- The structure may evolve as I continue to clean up and document individual projects.  
- Some code examples are intentionally minimal, focusing on understanding core concepts.

---

## Goals

- Maintain a single, well-organized repository for my Python-related work  
- Track and reflect on my progress as I continue learning and experimenting  
- Build a foundation to expand into larger, more complex projects over time

**Status:** Ongoing — new projects, refinements, and documentation updates will be added periodically.
